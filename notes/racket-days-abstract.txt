What is Whalesong?

    Whalesong is a compiler from Racket bytecode to JavaScript.


Why would anyone care?

    Because it allows Racket programs to be deployed on the web.
    Furthermore, Racket programs can access native JavaScript APIs.


What do you want to show?

    I want to show the tool in action, programs that use it, and some
    of the internals of how it works.

    I want to show uses of the FFI.

    As well as World programming.

    I also want to show performance numbers (which means benchmarks...)


How do you use it?

    I have a command line tool that consumes Racket programs and
    produces standalone JavaScript applications.


What were the technical advantages of your approach?

    Reusing the Racket compiler.  Strong possibility of reusing most
    of the Racket standard library, as soon as we can bootstrap
    racket/base.

What were some of the technical challenges?

    Supporting the features of the Racket virtual machine (tail calls,
    continuations)


What needs to be done next?

    Adding enough primitives to run racket/base
