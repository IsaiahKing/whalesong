Some possible optimizations:


Application:

    If any of the operands are constant (either by being variable
    lookups or literal constants), and if all of them are side-effect
    free, then juggle-operands might not be necessary.
    
    In a self-application, it's not necessary to compute the operator,
    since the value is in the top control frame.

    For a kernel primitive call, if all of the operands are all
    constant or stack references, there's no need to push for fresh
    stack space.
